Part-A Master Theorem Solution

Find the time complexity of the below functions in Θ form. Write NA if the function does not
apply to any case.
a) T (n) = 3T (n/2) + n
b) T (n) = 64T (n/8) − n^2(log n)
c) T (n) = 2nT (n/2) + n^n
d) T (n) = 3T (n/3) + n/2
e) .T (n) = 7T (n/3) + n^2
Note: You don’t have to submit the full solution, the final time complexity in form of Θ is perfectly
acceptable.
Time Complexity in any other asymptomatic notation will lead to zero marks.
You need to submit a text file (MS word, Notepad etc) in GitHub, name it as
